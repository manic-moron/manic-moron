- 👋 Hi, I’m @manic-moron
- 👀 I’m interested in not dying and not ending up homeless again. Housing market is fucked up.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning anything and everything I can, but mainly trying to learn lua so I can better customize awesomewm 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything some mad lad would actually trust me to do. 
- 📫 How to reach me:
 email: ptrscttmcnl@pm.me
 and that's about all I'm comfortable sharing publicly to be quite honest.
 I'm a 27 year old from Nova Scotia, Canada. I currently am unemployed and finally have enough free time to learn again, so here I am.
Trying to make my late Grandfather's laptop still usable by using as many lightweight options as possible. 
I'm currently running an install of BunsenLabs, but I will probably go back to Arch or another arch-based OS. Just wanted to try it as #! was nice.
Using awesomewm, gtk and tint because I'm an idiot probably. Or I just dont know any better. Please teach me if you're looking to tutor!!
